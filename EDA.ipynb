This exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to uncover patterns and relationships that are valuable for Airbnb’s strategic decision-making.This project focused on exploring and preparing a dataset for analysis. The data exploration phase involved examining and understanding the dataset’s characteristics, such as its structure, data types, presence of missing values, and value distributions. The cleaning phase addressed issues like errors, missing entries, and duplicate records, while also identifying and removing outliers.\n","\n","Through this process, we resolved any inconsistencies, ensuring the data was of high quality and suitable for further analysis. This crucial step minimized potential biases or errors that could influence the outcomes. The refined dataset is now well-prepared to address specific research questions.\n","\n","After cleaning and preparing the data, we proceeded to explore and summarize it by generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends. During this phase, we investigated relationships between variables and explored potential underlying causes for observed patterns or trends.\n","\n","We utilized data visualization techniques to interpret and uncover patterns in Airbnb data. Various charts and graphs were created to represent the data, with observations and insights documented for each visualization. This approach enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and identify meaningful insights and patterns.\n","\n","Through this analysis, we discovered trends and relationships that would have been challenging to discern from raw data alone. For instance, we identified factors such as minimum nights, number of reviews, and host listing counts as significant determinants of pricing. Additionally, we observed notable variations in availability across neighborhoods. These findings provide valuable insights for both travelers and hosts in the city.\n","\n","The insights and observations derived from this analysis serve as a foundation for future decision-making and analysis related to Airbnb.

***data type*** for '***last_review***' feature as it represent date but had object data type. so change it into ***datetime*** data type. Secondly, it was important to deal with null values before feature engineering as the scope of this project was to find relation amoung different features and find the trend and pattern and null values can skew the result, therefore i changed the ***name*** and ***host_name*** null value with ***'not known'***. Since total count of number of review equal to zero was equal to the count of null values in ***review per month***, and as there was no review for the month therefore review per month should also be zero therefore, i changed null value with ***zero***. Thirdly, since ***minimum value*** for ***price*** was ***zero***, and since there is no specific data available why it was zero for example whether any discount was given or because of some other reason, therefore i changed zero value with ***median*** as median is less sensitive to the presence of outliers than the mean, and can provide a more accurate representation of the central tendency of the data in these cases. Next added ***new column - number_of_booking*** and ***potenial_revenue_per_year*** as it will be helpful in forecasting potential revenue it can generate throughout year if ideally booked based on availability. Finally ***dropped*** the ***last_review*** date column even though it can be used to know how old our data can be and in sentiment analysis, but in the context of this analysis it may not be used and also dropped ***id*** column because the feature will ***not*** have any ***variability*** - every row will have a unique value, so the feature will not be able to provide any information about the relationship between the target variable and the feature. Ignored ***availability_365*** ***zero*** values to understand how these values are affecting overall business as being an airbnb host you should be available for atleast more than 1 day in entire year, its better to figure out what the reason may be,so a better anlysis on these number was needed.
